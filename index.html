								<h3>Hello and welcome to my digital protfolio!</h3>
								<p>I'm Noah Pritchard, a passionate and driven computer science professional with a strong foundation in back-end C programming, front-end JavaScript development, and numerical computations, particularly in Linear Algebra. My journey in technology has been fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to solve complex problems creatively and efficiently. Beyond my technical skills, I also take pride in my ability to communicate and collaborate effectively, making me well-suited for roles that blend analytical thinking with interpersonal engagement.</p>
								<p>The purpose of this digital portfolio is to provide an in-depth look at my professional and academic journey, showcasing my skills, experiences, and aspirations (<a href="#projects">projects here</a>). Whether you are a potential employer, collaborator, or simply someone interested in my work, this portfolio serves as a comprehensive resource to explore my expertise and accomplishments. I believe that technology is most powerful when it is both innovative and accessible, and I strive to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.</p>

								<p>Boulder Colorado has become my home the last four years and being involved and connected with the Boulder community has always been a very important goal of mine. To do this I have consistently volunteered to give back and spend time with the community I appreciate and love so much.</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/freeski.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Sports have heavily influenced who I am today, teaching me invaluable lessons and creating exceptional connections. Throughout my four years here I have been a member of the CU Boulder FreeSki Team, and have also been apart of Intramural soccer, football, and volleyball teams. </p>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Growing up, I've always had a passion for cars and everything related to them. I've been drawn to hands-on projects, and often ones
									that cause more trouble than good. However, they've taught me patience and resilience from a young age.  
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pc.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									That same passion carries over into electronics, where I enjoy fixing power tools or building and upgrading PCs. In the end, both have helped me develop a growth mindset, which has prepared me well for this 
									career path.
